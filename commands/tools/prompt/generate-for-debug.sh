INTRODUCTION="Hello! I need your help with a question about a project I'm developing.
I'll first give you the general context of my project before explaining my issue."

APP_GOAL="The application's goal is to create an online role-playing game where the story is told by a Game Master managed by an AI (LLM). This application is architected as microservices; it currently contains 5 main components:
- [frontend] Web component - provides an ergonomic web interface for players
- [backend] Universe component - provides structured information about an imaginary universe (D&D, Warhammer, etc.)
- [backend] Adventure component - manages universe instances, an adventure takes place in a universe and this component stores and exposes the player's progress in the initially chosen universe
- [backend] AI component - generates the next narrative steps for the player based on the chosen universe and adventure progress
- [backend] Game component - serves as the backend entry point after the Web component and orchestrates with other components in my architecture

Each component is managed via a Docker container, docker containers are defined in the \`./dockers\` folder, and finally I use a homemade command system (I can run commands like \`./commands.sh tools/docker/ls\`)"

TECHNOLOGIES="rust | docker | ia (llm ?)"

EXPERIENCE="I am a developer/QA engineer for ~10 years, and I want to learn how to use AI in my projects. This project allows me to train myself to use/integrate AI."
